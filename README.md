# JFDI-CMPDL: Just F---ing Do It - Curse Modpack Downloader

Because CurseForge is bad.

## What it does

Download Minecraft modpacks from CurseForge.

## How to use it

`$ python install.py path/to/zip/file`

## Why?

CurseForge changed their API, making it difficult for third-party launchers
to download modpacks. This project downloads an entire modpack into a folder
that you can import into the launcher of your choice: Be it MultiMC, PolyMC,

This fork has removed all references to the CurseForge API, and instead uses
the publicly available modpacks.ch API. This means that no API key is required
for usage.

## Fork

This is a fork of [modpack-installer]. This means this project is based on
modpack-installer. It doesn't mean that this project is associated with the
original authors and it also doesn't mean that it's endorsed by them. Please
do not contact the original authors about problems with this very project,
instead contact the fork authors. Thank you.

However, the authors of JFDI-CMPDL would like to take this opportunity to
express their gratitude for the modpack-installer codebase.
